# Machine_learning

In A, binary.py contains logistic regression, SVM and nueral network model.The pre-processing, model fit and results obtained are all included.
In B, multiple.py contains random forest and nueral network model. CNN.ipnb and CNN.py they are same, including model CNN as it requires further pre-processing datasets.
